NAME
    Any::Template::ProcessDir -- Process a directory of templates

VERSION
    version 0.06

SYNOPSIS
        use Any::Template::ProcessDir;

        # Process templates and generate result files in a single directory
        #
        my $pd = Any::Template::ProcessDir->new(
            dir => '/path/to/dir',
            process_text => sub {
                my $template = Any::Template->new( Backend => '...', String => $_[0] );
                $template->process({ ... });
            }
        );
        $pd->process_dir();

        # Process templates and generate result files to a separate directory
        #
        my $pd = Any::Template::ProcessDir->new(
            source_dir => '/path/to/source/dir',
            dest_dir   => '/path/to/dest/dir',
            process_file => sub {
                my $file = $_[0];
                # do something with $file, return content
            }
        );
        $pd->process_dir();

DESCRIPTION
    Recursively processes a directory of templates, generating a set of
    result files in the same directory or in a parallel directory. Each file
    in the source directory may be template-processed, copied, or ignored
    depending on its pathname.

CONSTRUCTOR
  Specifying directory/directories
    *   If you want to generate the result files in the same directory as
        the templates, just specify *dir*.

            my $pd = Any::Template::ProcessDir->new(
                dir => '/path/to/dir',
                ...
            );

    *   If you want to generate the result files in a separate directory
        from the templates, specify *source_dir* and *dest_dir*.

            my $pd = Any::Template::ProcessDir->new(
                source_dir => '/path/to/source/dir',
                source_dir => '/path/to/dest/dir',
                ...
            );

  Specifying how to process templates
    process_file
        A code reference that takes the full template filename and the
        `Any::Template::ProcessDir' object as arguments, and returns the
        result string. This can use Any::Template or another method
        altogether. By default it calls process_text on the contents of the
        file.

    process_text
        A code reference that takes the template text and the
        `Any::Template::ProcessDir' object as arguments, and returns the
        result string. This can use Any::Template or another method
        altogether.

  Optional parameters
    dir_create_mode
        Permissions mode to use when creating destination directories.
        Defaults to 0775. No effect if you are using a single directory.

    file_create_mode
        Permissions mode to use when creating destination files. Defaults to
        0444 (read-only), so that destination files are not accidentally
        edited.

    ignore_files
        Coderef which takes a full pathname and returns true if the file
        should be ignored. By default, all files will be considered.

    readme_filename
        Name of a README file to generate in the destination directory -
        defaults to "README". No file will be generated if you pass undef or
        if you are using a single directory.

    template_file_suffix
        Suffix of template files in source directory. Defaults to ".src".
        This will be removed from the destination file name.

        Any file in the source directory that does not have this suffix (or
        ignore_file_suffix) will simply be copied to the destination.

METHODS
    process_dir
        Process the directory. If using multiple directories, the
        destination directory will be removed completely and recreated, to
        eliminate any old files from previous processing.
