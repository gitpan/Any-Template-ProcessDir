DESCRIPTION
    Recursively processes a directory of templates, generating a parallel
    directory of result files. Each file in the source directory may be
    template-processed, copied, or ignored depending on its pathname.

CONSTRUCTOR
    Required parameters:

    source_dir
        Directory containing the template files.

    dest_dir
        Directory where you want to generate result files.

    Plus one of these:

    process_file
        A code reference that takes a single argument, the full template
        filename, and returns the result string. This can use Any::Template
        or another method altogether.

    process_text
        A code reference that takes a single argument, the template text,
        and returns the result string. This can use Any::Template or another
        method altogether.

    Optional parameters:

    dir_create_mode
        Permissions mode to use when creating destination directories.
        Defaults to 0775.

    file_create_mode
        Permissions mode to use when creating destination files. Defaults to
        0444 (read-only), so that destination files are not accidentally
        edited.

    ignore_files
        Coderef which takes a full pathname and returns true if the file
        should be ignored. By default, all files will be considered.

    readme_filename
        Name of a README file to generate in the destination directory -
        defaults to "README".

    template_file_suffix
        Suffix of template files in source directory. Defaults to ".src".
        This will be removed from the destination file name.

        Any file in the source directory that does not have this suffix (or
        ignore_file_suffix) will simply be copied to the destination.

METHODS
    process_dir
        Process the directory. The destination directory will be removed
        completely and recreated, to eliminate any old files from previous
        processing.
